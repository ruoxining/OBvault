This talk aims both to provide an introduction to the subject Philosophy of Language (a similar subject with semantics and pragmatics, according to its definition; PoL hereafter), and give a summary on the recent ongoing discussion on the linguistics concepts in NLP (e.g. "meaning", "understanding", "reasoning", "grounding").

## The Location of PoL on the Academic Coordinate
Before we start this talk, we will first provide a brief definition of the term *Philosophy of Language* in our talk here. The PoL concerns mainly the two following questions, (i) The relationship between the natural language and the world, (ii) The relationship between the human languages and their meaning. Chen (2003) believes that the PoL and the linguistics are two different subjects. He suggests that the linguistics is the study of language rules and patterns and the application of them, while the PoL pays more attention on the more abstract and essential features of the human language (e.g. its relation to the cognition). The author of this talk believes, according to the definition of PoL, it is a subject that closely involves the semantics and pragmatics branches in linguistics. However the PoL and linguistics overlap or not, it is commonly believed that the subject PoL was born in the 1920s, when the *linguistic turn* was put on stage in the European philosophy. 
## History of PoL 
Now we will dive into the history of PoL. This section is parted "person by person". It is noticed that "person-by-person" is a common structure of most of the philosophy history, as most of the philosophy progresses are propelled by giants instead of the common people.
